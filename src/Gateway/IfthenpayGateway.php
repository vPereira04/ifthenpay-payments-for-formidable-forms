 * Core business logic for the ifthenpay Formidable gateway.
 *
 * Called from the global bridge class `FrmIfthenpayActionsController::trigger_gateway()`
 * so the one class Formidable resolves by a dynamically-built name string
 * stays a thin shim.
 *
 * I create the real Formidable entry immediately, in a 'pending' state,
 * before ever redirecting to ifthenpay's hosted page — same as every other
 * Formidable payment gateway. An earlier version deferred entry creation
 * until payment was confirmed (mirroring PayPal Lite), but that can't work
 * for ifthenpay's offline methods (Multibanco, Payshop): a payer can pay
 * hours or days later with no live browser left to ever submit the form.
 * It also meant the payment reference shown to the payer never matched the
 * one the merchant later sees in Formidable's admin. Creating the entry up
 * front avoids both, at the accepted trade-off that an abandoned/failed
 * attempt now leaves a visible pending entry behind — the same trade-off
 * every other gateway module already makes.
